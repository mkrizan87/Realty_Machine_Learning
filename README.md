# Realty_Machine_Learning
OBJECTIVES
-To analyze our data
-To Use a Linear Regression model and compare it
-To Find What Features are important in the most expensive (650K +) houses
##Python
-Imported the data to analyze Real Estate and make a Linear model to see if we could accurately predict the price  
-We then compared the linear model to results of KNN and Decision Tree models
-Finally I added code, implementing a RandomForestRegression model to help determine which features were most important in predicting which houses are over 650K in value
---
##MySQL
-We used queries to answer questions on the data through looking at it as a table, this was straightforward and mostly relied on aggregations and sorting the results to answer said questions
---
##Tableau
-We imported our Data into Tableau to visualize it.
-Using different charts, plots, and maps we dove into our data from a different angle to understand it better
-I chose to make my dashboard using the visuals that best explained the patterns in houses valuing less or more than 650K
##PPT
-A simple PPT presentation that briefly explains goals, steps, decisions, and interpretation.
