*OBJECTIVES*
1. To analyze our data
2. To Use a Linear Regression model and compare it
3. To Find What Features are important in the most expensive (650K +) houses
---
**Python**
1. Imported the data to analyze Real Estate and make a Linear model to see if we could accurately predict the price  
2. We then compared the linear model to results of KNN and Decision Tree models
3. Finally I added code, implementing a RandomForestRegression model to help determine which features were most important in predicting which houses are over 650K in value

**MySQL**
1. We used queries to answer questions on the data through looking at it as a table, this was straightforward and mostly relied on aggregations and sorting the results to answer said questions
---
**Tableau**
1. We imported our Data into Tableau to visualize it.
2. Using different charts, plots, and maps we dove into our data from a different angle to understand it better
3. I chose to make my dashboard using the visuals that best explained the patterns in houses valuing less or more than 650K

**PPT**
1. A simple PPT presentation that briefly explains goals, steps, decisions, and interpretation.
